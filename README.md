This is a simple REST API developed with Go as part of my bachelor thesis. A PostgreSQL database in a Docker container was used to manage the data. The web framework used was [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and the database framework used was [pq](https://github.com/lib/pq).
The API provides interfaces for creating, reading, modifying, and deleting (CRUD) data.

In my bachelor thesis the performance is measured with the application [RestAPI_PerformanceTest](https://github.com/AndreasWeber87/RestAPI_PerformanceTest) and compared with the REST APIs in the languages [Node.js](https://github.com/AndreasWeber87/RestAPI_NodeJS) and [Python](https://github.com/AndreasWeber87/RestAPI_Python). The software [ProcessDockerStats](https://github.com/AndreasWeber87/ProcessDockerStats) was then used to evaluate the measurement results.
